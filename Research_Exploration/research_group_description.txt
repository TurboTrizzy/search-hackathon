If you're a student or researcher in the humanities, this group is likely the one for you! We need you to try out our search engine on your own project. The goal here is twofold: 1) to help you identify books that are relevant to your own research; and 2) to develop compelling use cases, so that, when we take our work to the press, we can demonstrate what this search engine is capable of!
