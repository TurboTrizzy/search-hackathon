It is likewise demonstrated that an Interest in Christ is built alone upon the Free, Absolute and Everlasting Love of the Father, Son and Spirit, towards a Remnant in Christ Jesus, against the Arminiant. And therein is some Account given of the Mystery of the Elect and their Union in Christ Jesus before the Foundation of the World; proving that their Free Grace-Union according to God's Ancient Settlements was never, as to the Comprehensive and Supreme Relation of the Elect in Jesus Christ, destroy'd by their Subordinate Nature-Fall in Adam. To these Things are added a Vindication of the Excellency of God's Free Grace against the whole Arminian Scheme. And Lastly, The Spiritual Operations of the Holy Ghost are vindicated, as the immediate Spring, Life and Source of all Practical Religion. Occasion'd by divers notorious errours in the writings of Mr. John Hunt of Northampton, and many other writers, preachers and professours of the Gospel on most sides: Who instead of increasing on the Foundation at this Day, have shamefully cast off the First Faith. And that now when the Water of Euphrates, or the Power of the Turk since the Peace of Carlowitz, hath been eminently dryed up, so as not to overflow the Western Monarchy as heretofore. And now likewise, altho' for the Elect's sake, God has shortened the Days, upon the Rising of the Two Witnesses in England, who rose and stood upon their Feet in this Street of the great City, Anno 1687, where they had been Stain in their open Testimony of experimental Religion, just Three Years and a half preceding. Yea, to make way for the coming of the Glorious Kingdom of Christ, we have seen the Seventh Angel in the Ministry of Christ, (presently for Dispatch since this last Liberty) pouring forth his Vial into the Air, which hath said with a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the Throne of the Glory-Man, it is Done: All is done in Christ Jesus before Believing. And on this has been further utter'd, The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and He shall Reign for ever and ever. Nevertheless Deserters of the Faith, even so far as was believ'd the Last Age, by their Unbelieving Voices from the Pulpit, and angry Thunders awing the People, have drown'd the Report of the 7th Angel. Time now for more Lightnings to come forth after them, towards the Advance of a Spiritual Reformation breath'd after.
